	<h1>COVID-19 and its Impact on New York and the US</h1>
	<h2>COVID-19 is still a major issue in the US and has not stopped affecting us.</h2>
	<em>By: Julieanne Gilchrist</em>
	<p>Covid-19 entered our country in March 2020 and almost two years later, it’s still here spreading and infecting people at a scary rate. Many people believed when Covid started that it would pass quickly and not have a huge effect on the country. The complete opposite happened instead. Covid has stayed with us since that day and has become the biggest talking point in media since. Even today, there are no signs that the end is near, or that its effect is waning. It is imperative that we as a country continue to treat this virus for what it is, a very alive and deadly threat to us. It has affected people in every state, especially New York State.</p>
	<p>New York is one of the biggest states in America with one of the largest populations, so, of course, Covid-19 has had a massive impact on the people living there. New York has been at the top of many Covid state stats. Per the New York Times, New York ranks number four in Covid cases and deaths, with over 2.9 million cases and almost 58,000 deaths. This is a result of New Yorkers not following covid protocols, but also the fact that the state holds a population over 19 million. It makes it even more imperative that people continue to wear their masks, keep social gatherings to a minimum, and think about getting vaccinated. </p>

	<p>Covid 19 has affected everyone’s livelihood and ability to do all the things that may be a part of their daily routine. As a result of this pandemic, many people have had to stop seeing their families in an attempt to stop the spread, while others have lost their jobs or had to work from home because their places of work want to stop the spread. As time has gone on and vaccines have become more readily available, those restrictions have calmed down. While this is a good thing, it has had its downsides. One of those downsides is the increase in Covid cases. </p>
	<p>As restrictions have cooled with the slowing of the spread compared to the earlier days and the option of a vaccine, people have felt more inclined to get back into their routines and do the things they love. While this is a good thing in theory, because we have to get back to a place of normalcy at some point, the fact remains that the virus has not gone anywhere. It is still alive and well and at its most dangerous in the wintertime when there is colder weather. </p>
	<p>In America’s first winter with the coronavirus, there was a massive surge in cases and death. According to The Atlantic, the winter season saw nearly 250,000 Americans dead, and hospitals being overwhelmed, which is a constant theme. We are in the beginning of our second winter and while there is little expectation of a surge as bad as last year’s, there is still a worry of a less destructive one. According to The Atlantic, there are three main factors that will determine this. Those are how our immunity holds up, how the virus changes, and how we behave. The virus is destined to spike because of how it performs in the winter but new variants, the amount of immunity we have from vaccines and naturally, and how well we follow protocols will determine its severity. </p>
	<p>Dr. Jazila Mantis, an Associate Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Division of Infectious Diseases, said there were expected surges during the winter season because of the cold weather and holidays. She did say, however, that the continued surge in New York and America in late July and August 2021 was a result of the delta variant becoming more prominent. According to Dr. Mantis, there is naturally going to be another surge in cases as another winter season approaches and the possibility of new variants is at the top of their priority list, especially with Omicron already here. </p>
	<p>It is very important that we do our part in helping curb the spread of Covid-19 during this season. Not only for the safety of each other but to help hospitals and first responders. As The Atlantic stated, hospitals have been overwhelmed during the winter season and in general. The effect Covid-19 has had on hospitals and their ability to help people without it has been drastic. </p>
	<p>Dr. Mantis said that hospitals being overwhelmed from Covid has not only hurt their ability to give them the resources they need, like beds and ventilators, but has also affected their ability to help people who are sick but not from Covid.  Covid is not the only reason people go to hospitals, but it is a main reason people have stopped going. The fear of Covid has stopped many people from going to the hospital for help with non-covid illness. On top of that, Dr. Mantis states that hospitals have had to say no to people that do want to come in because they have no room for them amongst the Covid patients.</p>

	<p>Covid is a deadly virus and more so for older people and those with underlying diseases. It is imperative that we do our part to help them stay protected from Covid as they are less likely to fight it off. Covid, while it can affect anyone, is more likely to seriously affect those who are already sick or of older age because of a weakened immune system. They need our help to stay protected. </p>
	<p>Covid is still a huge part of our lives and we have not reached a point where we can act like it’s not. We must continue to be safe and follow protocols so that we protect ourselves and others, especially now that we are entering winter season. </p>
